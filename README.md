Steps to run the app.
Note it uses React, Node. So before runnning you should make sure that system has node installed.

Once you have passed that stage.

Run these steps:-

1.) npm i 

2.) npm start

That's it, and you will see that 'npm i' command installs the node modules and essential libraries and after that by running npm start
we get the node up and running. Your terminal will redirect you to the browser's http://localhost:3000. Port number would be selected by the system, based upon which one is available.
